# mtcq personal webpage

This is the personal website of Marco TÃºlio Quintino, [https://mtcq.github.io/](https://mtcq.github.io/).


This website was designed using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a beautiful, simple, clean, and responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for academics. 

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.

## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).
Why Jekyll? Read [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)!


### Installation

#### Local Setup (Legacy, no longer supported)

For a hands-on walkthrough of running al-folio locally without using Docker, check out [this cool blog post](https://george-gca.github.io/blog/2022/running-local-al-folio/) by one of the community members!

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (_hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)_), and also [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (_hint: for ease of managing python packages, consider using a virtual environment, like [venv](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)_).

```bash
$ bundle install
# assuming pip is your Python package manager
$ pip install jupyter
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
